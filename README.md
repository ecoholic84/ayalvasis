---

## 🎨 Usage

### 1. **Configure Your Habitat**
   - Use the sidebar to select shape, mission type, crew size, and dimensions
   - Watch the 3D visualization update in real-time
   - Habitat becomes semi-transparent when modules are added

### 2. **Add Functional Modules**
   - Click "➕ Add Module" to open the module library
   - Select from 12 NASA-standard module types
   - System auto-calculates minimum size based on crew
   - Adjust dimensions if needed
   - Review adjacency recommendations and restrictions

### 3. **Arrange Your Layout**
   - **Drag modules** in 3D space to position them
   - Hover over modules to see details
   - Click to select (module glows and bounces)
   - Modules stay within habitat boundaries
   - Real-time validation feedback

### 4. **Manage Modules**
   - Click "📋 Modules" to open the Module Manager
   - View all placed modules with details
   - See validation errors and warnings
   - Delete modules with 🗑️ button
   - Click module in list to select in 3D

### 5. **Monitor Metrics**
   - Check the bottom bar for real-time statistics:
     - **Habitat Volume** - Total available space
     - **Module Volume** - Space occupied
     - **Space Utilization** - Efficiency percentage
     - **Volume per Crew** - NASA compliance
     - **Status** - Overall validation
   - Color coding:
     - ✅ Green = meets NASA constraints
     - ⚠️ Orange = warnings
     - ❌ Red = errors/insufficient space

### 6. **Validate Your Design**
   - System checks for:
     - Minimum volume per crew (15 m³)
     - Module size requirements
     - Critical modules present
     - Adjacency recommendations
   - Address errors (red) before saving
   - Review warnings (orange) for optimization

### 7. **Save Your Design**
   - Click "💾 Save Habitat" to persist complete design
   - Includes habitat config + all module positions
   - Click "📂 Load Habitat" to retrieve saved designs

### 8. **Explore Presets**
   - Load NASA preset layouts for inspiration
   - Modify and save your own variations

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
